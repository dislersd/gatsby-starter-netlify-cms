  title: I can code
  description: >-
    Since November 2018 I've been studying web development for 40 hours a week
    at Lambda School. I know UI design. I can build React apps. I can fetch data
    asynchronously with Redux dispatch functions. I can build routers with Node
    and Express. I can do data modeling and data persistence. Full stack
    development is a passion for me and building data intensive websites and
    applications that look and feel nice is my current focus.
